Whenever a `skript` is mentioned, it's refering to the skript accompanying the lecture: [Algorithms and Datastructures, 2022-12-12](http://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/2022_algorithmen/downloads_protected/vorlesung_main.pdf)

## Additional context

Both python implementations of `selection sort` and `quicksort` are located in `pythonSorting.py`.
All Tests for both algorithms can be found in `pythonTests.py`.
The java versions for both sorting algorithms are located in `javaSorting.java`.

(Since there is only one actual task, with 10 subtasks, the subtasks are therefore refered to as tasks)
Answers are primarily given in `sorting.ipqnb`.
Only those tasks, for which no designated palace was given, are answerd below, in this `README`.

## Task answers

### Task 2
The `pivot element`, in quicksort, is determineing how the input array is going to be `split up` into three arrays. One contains all elements that are strictly `smaller` that the pivot element, another all that are `equal` to the pivot element and the last all elements, that are strictly `larger` than the picot element. On these three arrays the quicksort algorithm is recusivly called, until the input array is reduced to one element.
In our implementation the pivot element is chosen `randomly`, from the elements from the imput array.

### Task 3
Imputs for `worst-case` running time of the implemented versions of selection sort and qicksort:
- Selection sort: As discussed in the lecture, for all possible input cases, they `all share the same asymptotic running time`: O(n^2). This is because the algorithm does not handle arrays, which are sorted in reverse, any different than sorted or partially sorted inputs.
- Quicksort: The asymtotic worst-case running time presents itselfe, when, by chance, the largest or smallest element, of the input array, is always chosen as pivot throughout all recursive calls. In the case, that all elements are also distinct, we end up only reducing the size of the unsorted-array by 1, which leads us to a worts-case running time of O(n^2).
